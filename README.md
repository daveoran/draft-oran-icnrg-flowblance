# icn-flic-manifest
FLIC Manifest RFC draft

# Editing

Inside each draft, you should use the suffix '-latest' in the draft name, for example:
```
<rfc category="exp" docName="draft-irtf-icnrg-ccnxmessages-latest" ipr="trust200902">
```

The file `versions` contains the draft version number for each document.  After you edit
a document, you should be sure to set the correct draft number.

To build the documents, cd in to the `src/` directory and run make.  This will download a subproject
to build the system.  It will replace the `build/` directory.
